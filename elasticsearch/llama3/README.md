# RAG-Elastic-Llama3

Building RAG with Llama 3 open-source and Elastic. 

The notebooks in this repo are companion to the blog content [Rag with Llama3 and Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/rag-with-llama3-elastic)

Two examples of RAG using Llama3 as an LLM. Llama3 will be hosted using Ollama locally.
 
1. Using Llama3 as an LLM and use it to generate embeddings.
2. Using Llama3 as an LLM and use Elastic ELSER for embeddings and semantic search.
